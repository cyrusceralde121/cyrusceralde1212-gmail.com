            <p>Dear Auntie Flor,</p>
            <p>To the best auntie ever, first and foremost, i wanna thank you for all the efforts and hardworking doings you have done for us. i know i don’t say this but i love you with my actions and not just for words. Thank you for being you and for being brave as you are on you’re own. i know life has been difficult for you lately but just know that God is always there for you and you’re love ones like us. You’re the most genuine and loving auntie i’ve ever known. no words could express how much life has been easier with you and i’m very thankful for that. thank you for saying those words that you believe in me when i don’t. I apologize for everything that i have done, i know it haven’t made you happy after that but i never intended to do it because i was guilty, you may think i didn’t care but i was indeed felt bad for myself for doing that and i know for myself that i was trying to do better, don’t worry because i’ll never do things like that again and get myself together as a better version of it.</p> 
            <P>I promise myself that all of you’re hard doings will pay you off as a bright future for me and being sucessful as i am. Someday you’ll be proud of me as i achieved as you’re future nurse hehe. I’ll try to have better grades and study hard for my future because i don’t want you to waste anything that you have done for us, i wanna see you and myself to be happy. The grades i have received during my school days has never made me proud because it wasn’t enough for me, even if how much i try it will still be the same. So, this time, i pray to God to make my life easier when entering this senior high. If it weren’t for you, i wouldn’t go to a better high quality school, thats why my family members are so glad and thankful to have you because you’re here with us.</P> 
            <p>You’re support means everything to us and i hope that it wouldn’t change. Thank you for completing me as a better version of myself, for being there when i needed you’re words, for making me happy and keeping me motivated. I wanna thank you for making me a part of you’re life because i feel the same way too. Even though i haven’t been good recently you still continue to accept and love me as i am. May you’re day be more special with the people you love. I am truly grateful that you are my Auntie. I wanna tell you how much i miss being around you and feeling you’re embrace against mine when you were here in the philippines, i truly do especially others would to. I hope you’d have a vacation here soon if you have a clear mind and thinking about it. Happy birthday auntie or also known as viewing as my second mother. I love you so much more than words can describe. Take care always and get better soon!</p>
            <p>Love,</p>
