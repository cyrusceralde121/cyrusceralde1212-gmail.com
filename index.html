            <p>Dear Auntie Flor,</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday, Auntie Flor! Thank you for all the support you give us. Thank you for sending us to school. Without you, I wouldn't be able to study here in Baguio. Your kindness and generosity mean the world to us. You are my inspiration, and soon I will be able to come to America and take care of you. I wish you continued good health, happiness, and a life filled with love and joy. May you always feel the warmth of our love and appreciation for everything you have done for us. Your wisdom and strength inspire us every day, and we are so blessed to have you in our lives.
            </p>

            <p>Dear Auntie Flor,</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday! I just wanna say thank you so much for your endless acts of generosity and all that you gave to us. If it weren't for you, Auntie Flor, we cannot study here in Baguio. I cannot express or tell how grateful I am to have an aunt like you. Your kindness and all the wisdom I learn from you are my inspiration to pursue my dream and keep going forward. And I just wanna say I'm sorry if we cannot call you or even message you. I'm really sorry, Auntie Flor. But enough of the drama. It's your birthday, and I wish you good health. May God guide you every day to keep you safe. May it be a reminder of just how cherished you are and how much you are loved by us. Happy Birthday, Auntie Flor! May your day be as wonderful and special as you are.
                With all my love,
                Kenneth</p>

            <p>Dear Auntie Flor,</p>
            <p>To the best auntie ever, first and foremost, i wanna thank you for all the efforts and hardworking doings you have done for us. i know i don’t say this but i love you with my actions and not just for words. Thank you for being you and for being brave as you are on you’re own. i know life has been difficult for you lately but just know that God is always there for you and you’re love ones like us. You’re the most genuine and loving auntie i’ve ever known. no words could express how much life has been easier with you and i’m very thankful for that. thank you for saying those words that you believe in me when i don’t. I apologize for everything that i have done, i know it haven’t made you happy after that but i never intended to do it because i was guilty, you may think i didn’t care but i was indeed felt bad for myself for doing that and i know for myself that i was trying to do better, don’t worry because i’ll never do things like that again and get myself together as a better version of it.</p> 
            <P>I promise myself that all of you’re hard doings will pay you off as a bright future for me and being sucessful as i am. Someday you’ll be proud of me as i achieved as you’re future nurse hehe. I’ll try to have better grades and study hard for my future because i don’t want you to waste anything that you have done for us, i wanna see you and myself to be happy. The grades i have received during my school days has never made me proud because it wasn’t enough for me, even if how much i try it will still be the same. So, this time, i pray to God to make my life easier when entering this senior high. If it weren’t for you, i wouldn’t go to a better high quality school, thats why my family members are so glad and thankful to have you because you’re here with us.</P> 
            <p>You’re support means everything to us and i hope that it wouldn’t change. Thank you for completing me as a better version of myself, for being there when i needed you’re words, for making me happy and keeping me motivated. I wanna thank you for making me a part of you’re life because i feel the same way too. Even though i haven’t been good recently you still continue to accept and love me as i am. May you’re day be more special with the people you love. I am truly grateful that you are my Auntie. I wanna tell you how much i miss being around you and feeling you’re embrace against mine when you were here in the philippines, i truly do especially others would to. I hope you’d have a vacation here soon if you have a clear mind and thinking about it. Happy birthday auntie or also known as viewing as my second mother. I love you so much more than words can describe. Take care always and get better soon!</p>
